Races of Myrasyl is an addon for Mr. Plague's Authentic Races.
Current in-development races:
Saturnians: Wizard moth people. They're based on my Starbound mod, and get bonuses to magic and summoning, as well as a slow fall ability.
Shelsnel: Snail people with high defense. They don't like fighting, but do their best to defend others.

Planned for the future:
Kyterrans: Mining Warrior Antlions
Scyphojel: Alien jellyfish people.
